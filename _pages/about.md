I am a cryptography researcher. I am currently pursuing my PhD at IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark  with Prof. Bernardo David. I work in the field of Applied Cryptography. My interests in particular include Secure Multiparty Computation, Zero Knowledge Proofs, Privacy Enhancing technologies. I have gained a special interest towards developing concretely efficient techniques in these fields, and bridging the gap between theory and practice. I have a masters in Computer Engineering from <a target=_blank href="https://www.biu.ac.il/en">Bar-Ilan University, Israel.</a>. I finished my undergraduation at <a target=_blank href="https://bits-pilani.ac.in/">BITS Pilani, Goa</a> with a double major in Math and Electronics. 

My masters thesis at <a target=_blank href="https://cyber.biu.ac.il/">The Center for Research in Applied Cryptography and Cyber Security, Bar Ilan Univeristy</a> was supervised by <a target=_blank href="https://www.eng.biu.ac.il/hazay/">Prof. Carmit Hazay</a>. The dissertation was on circumventing lower bounds in garbled circuits. 
  
I have previously worked as a consultant researcher in the <a target=_blank href="https://medium.com/privacy-scaling-explorations">Privacy And Scaling explorations</a> Group at <a target=_blank href="https://ethereum.foundation">Etheruem Foundation</a> and at <a target=_blank href="https://www.chain-reaction.io">Chain Reaction</a>, Israel. Apart from this, I have been a cryptography research intern at <a target=_blank href="https://qed-it.com/">QED-it</a> and at the <a target=_blank href = "https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=7284">Blockchain and Smart Contracts group</a> at <a target=_blank href ="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=8069">IBM Research India Labs.
